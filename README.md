Server grouping /hub and /lobby command

**This plugin only needs to be installed in BungeeCord/Waterfall.**

There is currently no development plan. I currently update the plug-in according to my own needs. Generally, I will update the plug-in once every 1-2 months to ensure that the plug-in is stable. If you have suggestions, please let me know.
